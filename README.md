# react-webpack-counter #

An very simple application meant to demonstrate React using webpack.

## Flux Choices ##

React as a library is fairly simple.  Many choose to use the
[Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) pattern with React, which increases
the amount of elements at play but does provide an understood flow for data.
There are [many choices for a Flux implementation](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/issues/22),
and this project contains a few in branches:

### Alt ###

The [`alt`](https://github.com/dylants/react-webpack-counter/tree/alt)
branch includes a solution using [Alt](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt).

### Redux ###

The [`redux`](https://github.com/dylants/react-webpack-counter/tree/redux)
branch includes a solution using [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux).
